This Project is done by the help of Machine Learning Supervised Learning technique by using the Multinomial Naive Byes Algorithim.
The Model recive text from the user and predict to which language the text belog to.
Concepts used here are Feature Selection,Feature Matrix and Count Vectorizer as well as Multinomial NB algorithim.
